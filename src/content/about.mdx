# Hello, I'm Timo Krug

> Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. *(Immanuel Kant)*

As a M.Sc. psychology student specializing in neuroscience and research methods, 
I enjoy exploring the intersection of mind, brain, and behavior using innovative statistical & computational methods. 
At the same time, I always aim to embed this approach into broader perspectives from other branches of psychology, cognitive science and philosophy.  
Professionally, I am currently working as a Senior Consultant at a small consultancy focusing on organizational psychology. 
In my additional role as Head of Psychometrics & Innovation I am responsible for creating and maintaining psychometric tests 
and for using innovative technologies to enhance our services in leadership assessment & development.  
At the heart of my academic and professional endeavours lies integration:
- of quantitative & qualitative methods
- of technology & humaneness
- of theory & application
