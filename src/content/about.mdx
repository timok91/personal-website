# Hello, I'm Timo Krug

> Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. *(Immanuel Kant)*

As a M.Sc. psychology student specializing in neuroscience and research methods, 
I enjoy exploring the intersection of mind, brain, and behavior using innovative statistical & computational methods. 
At the same time, I always aim to embedd this approach into broader perspectives from other branches of psychology, cognitive science and philosophy.  
Professionally, I am currently working as a Senior Consultant at a small consultancy focusing on organizational psychology. 
In my additional role as Head of Psychometrics & Innovation I am responsible for creating and maintaining psychometric tests 
and for using innovative technologies to enhance our services in leadership assessment & development.  
At the heart of my academic and professional endeavours lies integration:
- of quantitative & qualitative methods
- of technology & humaneness
- of theory & application


## Academic Interests

My research focuses on understanding how humans learn through social observation. 
I'm particularly interested in the processes of vicarious fear learning and the role of affect sharing in empathy. 
My work combines multiple methodologies including fMRI, skin conductance response, and pupillometry to investigate these complex phenomena.

### Vicarious Fear Learning

Vicarious fear learning is the process by which humans acquire fear responses by observing others' experiences with aversive stimuli. This phenomenon has significant implications for understanding anxiety disorders and phobias.

My research in this area involves:
- Investigating neural pathways involved in observational fear acquisition
- Examining individual differences in susceptibility to vicarious fear
- Developing experimental paradigms to measure observational fear conditioning
- Exploring the evolutionary basis of social learning mechanisms

### Affect Sharing & Empathy

Affect sharing is a core component of empathy that enables us to experience similar emotional states as those we observe in others. My work explores how affect sharing influences learning processes.

Key research questions include:
- How does affect sharing causally influence observational learning?
- What are the neural correlates of affect sharing during observational fear learning?
- Can we experimentally manipulate affect sharing to modulate learning outcomes?
- What role does affect sharing play in adaptive vs. maladaptive fear acquisition?

### Psychophysiological Modeling

I specialize in advanced methodological approaches for analyzing psychophysiological data, with a particular focus on pupillometry.

My methodological work includes:
- Developing and validating computational models for pupil data analysis
- Applying Psychophysiological Modeling (PsPM) to extract meaningful signals
- Combining multiple data streams (SCR, fMRI, pupil) for triangulation
- Improving analytical techniques for increased measurement sensitivity


## Beyond Work

Outside my professional work, I like:

### Reading

I enjoy reading about a wide variety of topics.

Books I recently read & liked:
- "Where Mathematics Come From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being" by George Lakoff & Rafael Núñez [currently reading]
- "Awakening From the Meaning Crisis: Part 1: Origins" by John Vervaeke & Christopher Mastropietro
- "The Matter With Things: Our Brains, Our Delusions and the Unmaking of the World" by Iain McGilchrist
- "The Uncontrollability of the World" by Hartmut Rosa
- "When Nietzsche Wept" by Irvin D. Yalom


### Creative Pursuits

When not immersed in research or consulting work, I enjoy:
- Photography, particularly capturing natural landscapes
- Writing about science and philosophy for general audiences
- Exploring interactive data visualization techniques

### Continuous Learning

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in:
- Machine learning and its applications in behavioral science
- Advanced statistical methods for analyzing complex datasets
- Science communication and knowledge translation
