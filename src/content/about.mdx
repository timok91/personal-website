# Hello, I'm Timo Krug

As a psychologist specializing in neuroscience and research methods, I enjoy exploring the intersection of mind, brain, and behavior. My professional journey has taken me from academic research to my current role as a Senior Consultant and Head of Psychometrics & Innovation.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on understanding how humans learn through social observation. I'm particularly interested in the processes of vicarious fear learning and the role of affect sharing in empathy. My work combines multiple methodologies including fMRI, skin conductance response, and pupillometry to investigate these complex phenomena.

### Vicarious Fear Learning

Vicarious fear learning is the process by which humans acquire fear responses by observing others' experiences with aversive stimuli. This phenomenon has significant implications for understanding anxiety disorders and phobias.

My research in this area involves:
- Investigating neural pathways involved in observational fear acquisition
- Examining individual differences in susceptibility to vicarious fear
- Developing experimental paradigms to measure observational fear conditioning
- Exploring the evolutionary basis of social learning mechanisms

### Affect Sharing & Empathy

Affect sharing is a core component of empathy that enables us to experience similar emotional states as those we observe in others. My work explores how affect sharing influences learning processes.

Key research questions include:
- How does affect sharing causally influence observational learning?
- What are the neural correlates of affect sharing during observational fear learning?
- Can we experimentally manipulate affect sharing to modulate learning outcomes?
- What role does affect sharing play in adaptive vs. maladaptive fear acquisition?

### Psychophysiological Modeling

I specialize in advanced methodological approaches for analyzing psychophysiological data, with a particular focus on pupillometry.

My methodological work includes:
- Developing and validating computational models for pupil data analysis
- Applying Psychophysiological Modeling (PsPM) to extract meaningful signals
- Combining multiple data streams (SCR, fMRI, pupil) for triangulation
- Improving analytical techniques for increased measurement sensitivity


## Academic Philosophy

I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches to tackle complex questions about human behavior. My work combines methodological rigor with theoretical innovation, always grounded in empirical evidence.

## Beyond Academia

Outside my professional work, I cultivate interests in:

### Philosophy & Critical Thinking

I'm drawn to epistemology and philosophy of science, exploring how we construct and validate knowledge. The works of Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and contemporary philosophers of mind have greatly influenced my thinking about scientific progress and understanding consciousness.

My philosophical interests include:
- The demarcation problem in science: distinguishing scientific from non-scientific claims
- The hard problem of consciousness and its implications for neuroscience
- Pragmatism and its approach to knowledge construction
- The replication crisis in psychology and proposed methodological reforms
- Ethical considerations in scientific research and AI development

### Creative Pursuits

When not immersed in research or consulting work, I enjoy:
- Photography, particularly capturing natural landscapes
- Writing about science and philosophy for general audiences
- Exploring interactive data visualization techniques

Some recent creative projects:
- A photo series documenting the psychological impact of natural spaces
- Data visualizations that make complex research findings accessible to non-experts
- Essays exploring the intersection of cognitive science and philosophy of mind
- Collaborations with artists to communicate scientific concepts through visual media

### Continuous Learning

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in:
- Machine learning and its applications in behavioral science
- Advanced statistical methods for analyzing complex datasets
- Science communication and knowledge translation

Recent learning journeys:
- Completing specialized coursework in causal inference methods
- Building skills in Python for advanced data analysis and visualization
- Studying the implications of large language models for cognitive science
- Developing expertise in advanced measurement techniques for psychophysiology
